# MLflow vs No-MLflow: MLOps Capability Comparison

This document provides a side-by-side comparison of how core MLOps tasks are handled **with MLflow** versus **without MLflow**, particularly in Databricks or production environments.

| **MLOps Task**                  | **With MLflow**                                                   | **Without MLflow**                                                 |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Experiment Tracking**         | `mlflow.log_param()`, `mlflow.log_metric()`, UI to compare runs     | Manually writing metrics in Excel, text files, or notebooks         |
| **Model Versioning**            | Auto-versioning in Model Registry                                  | Save as `model_v1.pkl`, `model_v2.joblib` in local/DBFS folders     |
| **Model Reproducibility**       | Tracks run code, parameters, environment                           | Requires manual documentation; no guaranteed reproducibility        |
| **Deployment: Batch**           | Load from Registry in Job, run scoring                             | Manually load file paths, hardcoded in notebooks                    |
| **Deployment: Real-Time**       | Use Mosaic AI Model Serving (REST endpoint, serverless)            | Build custom Flask/FastAPI + deploy on VM/K8s + handle infra        |
| **Model Registry**              | `mlflow.register_model()`, manage Staging → Production             | Folder naming or ad-hoc tracking with Google Sheets/Slack           |
| **Stage Promotion & Approval**  | MLflow UI or API (Staging → Prod), tagging, comments               | Manual “flagging” or renaming folders/files                         |
| **Inference Logging**           | Store predictions + inputs via `mlflow.log_metrics()` or Delta     | Need to manually log to CSV/Delta; hard to trace per model version  |
| **Drift Detection**             | Schedule checks via DLT, Delta + logs by model version             | Hard to automate; can't trace drift to model version easily         |
| **CI/CD Integration**           | Bundles + `mlflow.pyfunc` + GitHub Actions                         | Custom Bash scripts; fragile and error-prone                        |
| **Monitoring Dashboards**       | Delta tables + SQL dashboard per model/version                     | One-size-fits-all or no visibility                                  |
| **Rollback to Previous Version**| Click in Registry to revert to previous version                    | Manually reload older model file (if still available)               |
| **Environment Tracking**        | Conda/pip env saved with model artifact                            | Dev vs Prod mismatch risk high                                     |
| **Team Collaboration**          | Tags, comments, stage transitions, ownership                       | Tribal knowledge, Slack threads, informal review                    |

## Summary

Without MLflow, you're relying on manual, ad-hoc, and non-reproducible approaches.  
With MLflow, you gain a structured, traceable, and automatable MLOps workflow — especially powerful when integrated into the Databricks ecosystem.
“Here’s the reality. You can do MLOps without MLflow —
but it’s mostly manual, fragile, and unscalable.”

“MLflow provides a consistent layer across tracking, versioning, deployment, and monitoring —
and it works inside Databricks, on AWS, Azure, or even your laptop.”
